              <p class="fs-14 c-brown pb-20">CML lawyers are licensed to practice law only within a limited number of states, but we affiliate or form relationships with lawyers throughout the United States. CML may refer prospective clients to other law firms located throughout the country, who form relationships with CML, and are experienced in handling such cases. CML may also undertake legal representation in certain cases, and will affiliate with other legal counsel located throughout the country to provide legal representation. The laws of each State are different. The Site contains information about general or common rules that apply in some states. The Site also contains information about verdicts or settlements in past cases. You cannot assume that the same rules apply, or that the same result would occur, in your state or any particular state. The Statute of Limitations is especially important. Every state has laws called the “statute of limitations” which set a deadline to file a lawsuit. That means that a lawsuit filed too late may be thrown out, regardless of the defendant’s fault or the severity of the injuries. Some states have a two-year period for negligence injury claims; the time period in other states may be longer or shorter. Insurance policies, particularly homeowners insurance, may require that suit be filed within one year of a loss. Some states allow claims against government agencies, but require a written notice very soon after the accident, perhaps within three months. Because investigation and research is needed to identify all possible defendants and theories of recovery, if you have an accident or injury, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible.</p>
